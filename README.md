# Blockchain Commons Provenance Marks for Rust

<!--Guidelines: https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/secure-template/wiki -->

### _by Wolf McNally_

## Introduction

[Provenance Marks](https://provemark.com) provide a cryptographically-secured system for establishing and verifying the authenticity of works in an age of rampant AI-powered manipulation and plagiarism. By combining cryptography, pseudorandom number generation, and linguistic representation, this system generates unique, sequential marks that commit to the content of preceding and subsequent works. These marks ensure public and easy verification of provenance, offering robust security and intuitive usability. Provenance Marks are particularly valuable for securing artistic, intellectual, and commercial works against fraud and deep fakes, protecting creators’ reputations and the integrity of their creations.

## Getting Started

```toml
[dependencies]
provenance-mark = "0.13.0"
```

## Specification

Provenance Marks are specified in [this white paper](https://provemark.com).

There is also a reference implementation in [Swift](https://github.com/wolfmcnally/provenance).

## Gordian Principles

Gordian Envelope is a reference implementation meant to display the [Gordian
Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles),
which are philosophical and technical underpinnings to Blockchain Commons'
Gordian technology. This includes:

- **Independence.** `how does it demonstrate independence`
- **Privacy.** `how does it demonstrate privacy`
- **Resilience.** `how does it demonstrate resilience`
- **Openness.** `how does it demonstrate openness`

Blockchain Commons apps do not phone home and do not run ads. Some are available through various app stores; all are available in our code repositories for your usage.

`REMOVE THIS SECTION UNLESS THIS IS A REFERENCE APP MEANT TO DEMONSTRATE GORDIAN PRINCIPLES`

## Status - Community Review

Gordian Envelope is currently in a community review stage. We would appreciate your consideration and/or testing of the libraries. Obviously, let us know if you find any mistakes or problems. But also let us know if the API meets your needs, if the functionality is easy to use, if the usage of Rust feels properly standardized, and if the library solves any problems you are encountering when doing this kind of coding. Also let us know how it could be improved and what else you'd need for this to be just right for your usage. Comments can be posted [to the Gordian Developer Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions/116).

Because this library is still in a community review stage, it should not be used for production tasks until it has had further testing and auditing.

See [Blockchain Commons' Development Phases](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/blob/master/release-path.md).

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Gordian Developer Community**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about interoperable wallet specifications, please use the Discussions area of the [Gordian Developer Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions). This is where you talk about Gordian specifications such as [Gordian Envelope](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents/blob/master/Docs/00-INTRODUCTION.md), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), and [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur) as well as the larger [Gordian Architecture](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Architecture.md), its [Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles) of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness, and its macro-architectural ideas such as functional partition (including airgapping, the original name of this community).

[**Gordian User Community**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions). For users of the Gordian reference apps, including [Gordian Coordinator](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/iOS-GordianCoordinator), [Gordian Seed Tool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS), [Gordian Server](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS), [Gordian Wallet](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS), and [SpotBit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit) as well as our whole series of [CLI apps](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Apps.md#cli-apps). This is a place to talk about bug reports and feature requests as well as to explore how our reference apps embody the [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles).

[**Blockchain Commons Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions). For developers, interns, and patrons of Blockchain Commons, please use the discussions area of the [Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community) to talk about general Blockchain Commons issues, the intern program, or topics other than those covered by the [Gordian Developer Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions) or the
[Gordian User Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions).

### Other Questions & Problems

As an open-source, open-development community, Blockchain Commons does not have the resources to provide direct support of our projects. Please consider the discussions area as a locale where you might get answers to questions. Alternatively, please use this repository's [issues](./issues) feature. Unfortunately, we can not make any promises on response time.

If your company requires support to use our projects, please feel free to contact us directly about options. We may be able to offer you a contract for support from one of our contributors, or we might be able to point you to another entity who can offer the contractual support that you need.

## Responsible Disclosure

We want to keep all of our software safe for everyone. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. We are unfortunately not able to offer bug bounties at this time.

We do ask that you offer us good faith and use best efforts not to leak information or harm any user, their data, or our developer community. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before you publish it. Do not defraud our users or us in the process of discovery. We promise not to bring legal action against researchers who point out a problem provided they do their best to follow the these guidelines.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@BlockchainCommons.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name              | Fingerprint                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Christopher Allen | FDFE 14A5 4ECB 30FC 5D22 74EF F8D3 6C91 3574 05ED |

You can import a key by running the following command with that individual’s fingerprint: `gpg --recv-keys "<fingerprint>"` Ensure that you put quotes around fingerprints that contain spaces.
